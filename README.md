# Simple App On How To Implement Authorization And Authentication

## Functionalities Of The App

### 1. Authentication and authorization system for users (login and signup) with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt password encryption.
### 2. Protecting routes for specific roles (Student, Admin) with middleware functions to check the JWT and user's role.
### 3. Database connection with MongoDB using Mongoose.
### 4. Express application using middleware functions (cookie-parser, expressjson) to handle incoming requests.
### 5. User model definition with Mongoose to set the fields for the User document in MongoDB.

## These Are The Things I Learned While Creating This Project

### 1) JWT And Its Methods Such As JWT.sign() & JWT.verify()
### 2) Bcrypt Library And Its Methods Such As bcrypt.hash() & bcrypt.compare()
### 3) Cookies and Cookie Parser
### 4) Middlewares Such As Express.json() And Cookie Parser
